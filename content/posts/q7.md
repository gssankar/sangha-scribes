I have met many teachers in my life so far. From my school days, I started following their advice. In my school, I met various teachers through different subjects. But not all teachers are similar characters and have a different style of teaching. Some teachers teach very carefully, while others teach openly. Still, some teachers give many advices during teaching time, and some don't. This is different from the styles of teachers and their mindsets. As that, students are also similar in that some are very interested in their education, while others spend time on nonsense. In our tradition, even family members or teachers advise their students or children to be kind persons in the world and never harm others. I think, in other cultures when they give advice to students or own children, they emphasize education and economics for the future.

In my life journey, I have met many good-quality teachers in the past. They guided me on how moral education is important in people's lives, how a good character is important in my life. These are basic things for people's lives, society, and world. So some of my teachers advised me when I was going to school: be a kind person and never harm others, regardless of whether you're educated or not. Always be friendly with all people, and that makes your life happy. This advice has impacted my life so far, and it's useful in my life. When I was going down the wrong path or doing wrong things in my life, this advice led me to a good path. Sometimes, these advices are better than education. Some educated people create many problems in this world because of lack of moral advice.

**Submission**

My met so many teachers in my life so far. From my school time, I start to follow the teachers advice. In my school I met various teachers through the different subjects. But all teachers are not similar characters and have a different style to teach. Some teachers are teaching very care and some are teaching very openly. Still some teachers giving so many advice with teaching time and some are not that. This are different styles of the teachers and different mind set of the teachers. As that, students are also similar as that, some are giving to much interest on their education and some are spent time with nonsense. In our tradition, even your family or your teacher, their first advice to their students or baby is to be kind person in world and never harm to other person. I think, in other culture when they giving a advice to the students or own baby. They pointed on education and economic of the future.

In my life journey, I met so many good quality teachers in the past. They guide me how is moral education is important in peoples lives, how is good character is important in my life. This are basic things for the peoples lives, society and world. So some of my teachers advice me, when I was going to school. To be a kind person and never harm to other,rather you were educated or not. Always friendly with all peoples and that makes your life happy. That advice impact in my life so far and it is useful in my life. When I was going on bad things or doing wrong things in my life, that advice leading me to good path. So some time the advice is better than the education. Some educated peoples makes so many problems in this world though lack of moral advice.
