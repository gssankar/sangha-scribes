My monastery's name is Sera Mey Monastery, located in southern India. Southern India is home to many monasteries; most of the larger ones are situated here. When His Holiness the Dalai Lama requested a state minister to allocate land for Tibetan refugees, the Karnataka Chief Minister kindly offered the land to His Holiness for this purpose. As a result, many monasteries and Tibetan colonies were established in southern India. However, we were only granted forestland, not pre-cleared land suitable for building houses or farming. Our elder generation cleared the forest and prepared it for habitation and agriculture. At that time, our elder generation faced significant challenges in settling the Tibetan colony and monastery here. Through this process, we Tibetans have been settled in southern India to pursue new knowledge.

After clearing the forest, our elder generation built monasteries and schools in Tibetan villages to educate monks and young people. Gradually, all our monasteries and villages grew from every direction. As a result of the increasing population, education and economy also developed organically. The current state of the Tibetan colony in southern India is truly beautiful. This place has become my second home, where I have spent over 30 years studying. The weather and food are well-suited to my lifestyle. Especially, the climate here is very balanced – neither too hot like Delhi in summer nor too cold like Himachal in winter. Ha ha! Life in a monastery is indeed very simple and peaceful.

**Submission**

My Monastery name is called Sera Mey Monastery. It’s located in south India. In general, at South India there have many Monasteries, typically most of the larger Monasteries are settled in South India, Because of that when His Holiness the Dalai Lama request to states Minister for land to settle the Tibetan Refugee. At that time, Karnataka Chief Minister happily offered the land to His Holiness for Tibetan refugee. Reason of that, many monastery and many Tibetan colony was located in South India. But they offered us just forest land not a ready made land for build house or farming. So, our old generation cut down the forest and made clear land for build house and for farming. On that time, our old generation struggle so much for settle the Tibetan colony and monastery at here. Through the process of that, we Tibetans are settled in south India for study in new knowledge.

After completed cutting the forest, our old generation build some monasteries and some school in Tibetan village for study the monks and young peoples. Gradually all our monastery and villages are developed from any direction. Through the amount of population of monk and lay people are increased in year b year. Through increasing the amount of population, beside that develop the education and economy automatically. Current condition of Tibetan colony in South India is very beautiful from all. Now this is my second home in my life. I spent over 30 years at here with my study. weather and food all are very match with my life style. Especially the weather is very balance at here not so hot in summer as Delhi and not so cold in winter as Himachal. Ha ha Life in monastery is very simple and quiet.
