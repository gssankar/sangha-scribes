      <description>I have met many teachers in my life so far. From my school days, I started following their advice. In my school, I met various teachers through different subjects. But not all teachers are similar characters and have a different style of teaching. Some teachers teach very carefully, while others teach openly. Still, some teachers give many advices during teaching time, and some don&amp;rsquo;t. This is different from the styles of teachers and their mindsets.</description>

      <title>A Monk&#39;s Reflections on Childhood in Tibet</title>

      <description>I was born in Tibet, and my family&amp;rsquo;s occupations were both farming and nomadic herding. As a result, most of my childhood memories are based on these conditions.
In the spring, some of my family members go to the nomadic place with yaks, sheep, and goats. Nomads never stay in one place for a long time; they change locations every week or month, depending on how much good grass is available for the animals.</description>

      <title>A Day in the Life: Meals at My Monastery</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/sangha-scribes/posts/monastery-meals/</link>

      <description>Today, I am going to describe my daily meals in the monastery. In our monastery and school, the meals are served by the monastery. I think this is similar to all monasteries and schools at any place. Typically, we have three meals a day in our monastery. We have a friendly kitchen for all monks. From there, they serve three meals to each monk every day. So, the schedule of the meal in a day is: morning bell ring at 7 am, afternoon at 11:30 am, and evening at 5 pm.</description>

      <title>My Experience with Meditation: Concentration vs. Analyzing</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/sangha-scribes/posts/meditation-experience-concentration-analyzing/</link>

      <description>Today, I will outline the times of day when I engage in meditation. Normally, meditation has two different types: one is called concentration meditation, and the other is called analyzing meditation.
Concentration meditation involves sitting in one place and focusing your mind on a single object for an extended period. The length of time you meditate depends on your practice level. As a beginner, it&amp;rsquo;s challenging to meditate for long periods without distractions entering your mind.</description>

      <description>Today, I will share some of my favorite books, quotes, and scriptures. Over the years, I have read numerous scriptures during my study times. However, these readings were not always based on personal preference but rather for exam purposes.
During my free time, reading a book is quite rare in my life. However, a few years ago, I came across a book by our Guru, His Holiness the Dalai Lama. The title of the book was &amp;ldquo;My Land and My People.</description>

      <description>Today is Friday, and Fridays are considered to be an auspicious day in our tradition.
This morning, I woke up at 6 am, brushed my teeth and freshened up as usual. After that, I offered water and incense to Lord Buddha and my root Guru, and prayed for all sentient beings who are alive in this beautiful world.
Then, I sat on my bed with folded legs and assumed a vertical body position.</description>

      <description>My Monastery name is Sera Mey Monastic University, located in Karnataka state, South India. I joined Sera Mey Monastery in 1992. From 1992 to 2022, I dedicated all my time to studying various subjects and topics. When I first joined the monastery, I attended the school for studying modern knowledge education, including English, Mathematics, science, and Tibetan language. I studied these subjects for seven years.
At that time, my life was very interesting and happy.</description>
