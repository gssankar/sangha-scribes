How teachers&rsquo; advice impacts my life.
I have met many teachers in my life so far. From my school days, I started following their advice. In my school, I met various teachers through different subjects. But not all teachers are similar characters and have a different style of teaching. Some teachers teach very carefully, while others teach openly.

Some educated people make many problems in this world because of lack of moral advice.\nFeedback and Improvements:\nThe text has a clear and relatable topic. The writer shows a good understanding of the importance of teachers’ advice. The text could benefit from more varied sentence structures to improve readability. There are some instances of repetitive language (e.g., “some time” is repeated). The use of “my” and “I” is consistent, but it would be helpful to add more descriptive language to make the writing more engaging.
