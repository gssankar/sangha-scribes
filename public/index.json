[{"content":"Today, I will outline the times of day when I engage in meditation. Normally, meditation has two different types: one is called concentration meditation, and the other is called analyzing meditation.\nConcentration meditation involves sitting in one place and focusing your mind on a single object for an extended period. The length of time you meditate depends on your practice level. As a beginner, it\u0026rsquo;s challenging to meditate for long periods without distractions entering your mind. However, with regular practice, you can cultivate the ability to focus for longer durations and delve deeper into the benefits of meditation.\nOn the other hand, analyzing meditation is quite different from the concentration meditation. During this type of meditation, we seek to understand the nature and reasons behind objects or phenomena. For instance, if we consider a book, we might ask ourselves why it\u0026rsquo;s called a book, how it came into being, and how its physical properties (such as cells and atoms) are combined. Here we focus on the resources of the object. Another example could be reflecting on the impermanence of the book - observing how it changes day by day, and recognizing that it ever truly is new. Here we focus on the reasons and logic of the object.\nHowever, in today\u0026rsquo;s time, most people who are interested in meditation are learning about concentration meditation. Typically, Westerners are very interested in concentration meditation, while there is a lack of interest in analyzing meditation. This may be because people who are struggling with depression or family problems or relationship issues often find temporary relief by focusing on one object for a time. So, they opt for concentration meditation.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/sangha-scribes/posts/meditation-experience-concentration-analyzing/","summary":"Today, I will outline the times of day when I engage in meditation.

Over the years, I have read numerous scriptures during my study times. However, these readings were not always based on personal preference but rather for exam purposes.\nDuring my free time, reading a book is quite rare in my life. However, a few years ago, I came across a book by our Guru, His Holiness the Dalai Lama. The title of the book was \u0026ldquo;My Land and My People.\u0026rdquo; This book has been an incredible and fascinating addition to my life. It recounts the story of when the Tibetans sought refuge in India and how His Holiness managed to stay in India for a long time.\nWhen His Holiness and the Tibetans arrived in India, they didn\u0026rsquo;t know mcuh about the conditions and climate of India. So they faced numerous challenges due to language and environmental differences. Many Tibetans lost their lives due to hot weather and unfamiliar food.\nIn this book \u0026ldquo;My Land and My People\u0026rdquo;, His Holliness writes about how he planned for their settlement in India. He established schools, monasteries, and hospitals, paving the way for future generations to receive an education. Today, we can look back on his vision and see its incredible impact on Tibetan life. With the implementation of his plans, most Tibetans have become educated.\nNot only that, many Tibetan lamas and Geshes have contributed significantly to Western and Indian society through education and psychology. All this is a testament to the grace of Our Holy Guru, His Holiness the Dalai Lama.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/sangha-scribes/posts/my-favourite-book-my-land-my-people/","summary":"Today, I will share some of my favorite books, quotes, and scriptures.

After that, I offered water and incense to Lord Buddha and my root Guru, and prayed for all sentient beings who are alive in this beautiful world.\nThen, I sat on my bed with folded legs and assumed a vertical body position. I focused on love and compassion, and recited some mantras of deities.\nAfter completing those tasks, I had breakfast with my disciple and shared some thoughts with each other. My disciple then went to his room to memorise the debating class scripture. I began my daily prayer with quiet movements.\nDuring my prayer time, I can sometimes think about positive thoughts very deeply. However, at other times, many negative thoughts arise, attempting to destroy my virtues. This is the condition of most people\u0026rsquo;s minds. Good things don’t happen everyday, and so does bad things.\nMost of our daily lives are spent doing good things for others and thinking about other’s wellbeing. We do not need to think about families, occupations, or similar concerns. Our lifestyle is simple and free from many general problems. This is the life of a monk. However, before entering monk life, one must sacrifice various things, which many people are unaware of. They merely see monk life as happy and say \u0026ldquo;blah blah blah\u0026rdquo; behind them. That is all; I don\u0026rsquo;t have any typical activities in my daily routine.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/sangha-scribes/posts/monk-daily-life-friday/","summary":"Today is Friday, and Fridays are considered to be an auspicious day in our tradition.\nThis morning, I woke up at 6 am, brushed my teeth and freshened up as usual.

I joined Sera Mey Monastery in 1992. From 1992 to 2022, I dedicated all my time to studying various subjects and topics. When I first joined the monastery, I attended the school for studying modern knowledge education, including English, Mathematics, science, and Tibetan language. I studied these subjects for seven years.\nAt that time, my life was very interesting and happy. Since I was young, I had no plans for the future. I just focused on my studies and enjoyed my free time. I performed well in my classes, sometimes even topping them.\nAfter completing my schooling, I joined the monastery\u0026rsquo;s debate class to study Buddhist philosophy for seventeen years. My great guru from the Monastery guided me through these studies on the five major subjects. In 2009, I registered for the Gelug University Exam to earn a degree. After a month, I was informed that I had passed the exam. Then I prepared for the biggest exam in my life. This six-year exam involved fierce competition not only between students but also among monasteries, as students came from various monasteries. I completed this exam and received my degree along with a certificate at the end of 2022.\nDuring these years, I did not engage in any special activities but I took on normal student jobs such as school captain and joined Tibetan freedom struggles. Now that I have completed all my monastery studies, I am taking it easy and trying to learn new things. I believe, life is for learning, and this has been my journey through the monastery. Thank you.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/sangha-scribes/posts/my-monastery-journey-learning-growth/","summary":"My Monastery name is Sera Mey Monastic University, located in Karnataka state, South India.
