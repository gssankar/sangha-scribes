[{"content":"My monastery\u0026rsquo;s name is Sera Mey Monastery, located in southern India. Southern India is home to many monasteries; most of the larger ones are situated here. When His Holiness the Dalai Lama requested a state minister to allocate land for Tibetan refugees, the Karnataka Chief Minister kindly offered the land to His Holiness for this purpose. As a result, many monasteries and Tibetan colonies were established in southern India. However, we were only granted forestland, not pre-cleared land suitable for building houses or farming. Our elder generation cleared the forest and prepared it for habitation and agriculture. At that time, our elder generation faced significant challenges in settling the Tibetan colony and monastery here. Through this process, we Tibetans have been settled in southern India to pursue new knowledge.\nAfter clearing the forest, our elder generation built monasteries and schools in Tibetan villages to educate monks and young people. Gradually, all our monasteries and villages grew from every direction. As a result of the increasing population, education and economy also developed organically. The current state of the Tibetan colony in southern India is truly beautiful. This place has become my second home, where I have spent over 30 years studying. The weather and food are well-suited to my lifestyle. Especially, the climate here is very balanced – neither too hot like Delhi in summer nor too cold like Himachal in winter. Ha ha! Life in a monastery is indeed very simple and peaceful.\n","permalink":"https://sangha.gssh.site/posts/tibetan-monk-home-south-india-monastery/","summary":"My monastery\u0026rsquo;s name is Sera Mey Monastery, located in southern India.

From my school days, I started following their advice. In my school, I met various teachers through different subjects. But not all teachers are similar characters and have a different style of teaching. Some teachers teach very carefully, while others teach openly. Still, some teachers give many advices during teaching time, and some don\u0026rsquo;t. This is different from the styles of teachers and their mindsets. As that, students are also similar in that some are very interested in their education, while others spend time on nonsense. In our tradition, even family members or teachers advise their students or children to be kind persons in the world and never harm others. I think, in other cultures when they give advice to students or own children, they emphasize education and economics for the future.\nIn my life journey, I have met many good-quality teachers in the past. They guided me on how moral education is important in people\u0026rsquo;s lives, how a good character is important in my life. These are basic things for people\u0026rsquo;s lives, society, and world. So some of my teachers advised me when I was going to school: be a kind person and never harm others, regardless of whether you\u0026rsquo;re educated or not. Always be friendly with all people, and that makes your life happy. This advice has impacted my life so far, and it\u0026rsquo;s useful in my life. When I was going down the wrong path or doing wrong things in my life, this advice led me to a good path. Sometimes, these advices are better than education. Some educated people create many problems in this world because of lack of moral advice.\n","permalink":"https://sangha.gssh.site/posts/how-teachers-shape-our-lives/","summary":"I have met many teachers in my life so far.

As a result, most of my childhood memories are based on these conditions.\nIn the spring, some of my family members go to the nomadic place with yaks, sheep, and goats. Nomads never stay in one place for a long time; they change locations every week or month, depending on how much good grass is available for the animals. Nomadic life relies heavily on the animals. We get many things from the animals\u0026rsquo; resources to survive our lives. Life with animals is very interesting, especially when I had the chance to ride on a yak – that was my happiest experience during nomadic life.\nFarmers\u0026rsquo; life is different from nomad life. Farmers depend on their farm and work hard for their families\u0026rsquo; occupations. However, most farmers receive little benefit from their farm resources. During this time, I was very young and couldn\u0026rsquo;t participate in the fieldwork. I don\u0026rsquo;t have childhood memories about farming. But I remember how my family worked on the farm. In the spring, they start the farm work and sow seeds. At the end of summer, they collect the harvest.\nApart from these, I don\u0026rsquo;t have many experiences or memories about my childhood lifestyle.\n","permalink":"https://sangha.gssh.site/posts/monk-childhood-tibet/","summary":"I was born in Tibet, and my family\u0026rsquo;s occupations were both farming and nomadic herding.

In our monastery and school, the meals are served by the monastery. I think this is similar to all monasteries and schools at any place. Typically, we have three meals a day in our monastery. We have a friendly kitchen for all monks. From there, they serve three meals to each monk every day. So, the schedule of the meal in a day is: morning bell ring at 7 am, afternoon at 11:30 am, and evening at 5 pm. The quality of the meal is mostly the same in the morning and afternoon; the evening meal is a little different from the other two.\nThe typical meals we have in my monastery are as follows: In the morning, it\u0026rsquo;s always bread, tea, and jam or butter that changes daily. In the afternoon, we have rice, dal, and fruit. And in the evening they serve different things each day. Some examples of evening meals are Tibetan Thukpa, bread with vegetables, Chowkmein, Tingmo with vegetables, and so on.\nUsually, most monks have a kitchen in their room. So, some monks make extra vegetables with rice or bread when they receive the monastery meal. All meals in the monasteries are vegetarian every day. If someone wants to eat meat for a meal, you never get that in the monastery; you need to go outside of the monastery. On special occasions at the monastery, they also serve typical food to the monks from the kitchen. Actually, those meals are also similar to the above.\n","permalink":"https://sangha.gssh.site/posts/monastery-meals/","summary":"Today, I am going to describe my daily meals in the monastery.

Normally, meditation has two different types: one is called concentration meditation, and the other is called analyzing meditation.\nConcentration meditation involves sitting in one place and focusing your mind on a single object for an extended period. The length of time you meditate depends on your practice level. As a beginner, it\u0026rsquo;s challenging to meditate for long periods without distractions entering your mind. However, with regular practice, you can cultivate the ability to focus for longer durations and delve deeper into the benefits of meditation.\nOn the other hand, analyzing meditation is quite different from the concentration meditation. During this type of meditation, we seek to understand the nature and reasons behind objects or phenomena. For instance, if we consider a book, we might ask ourselves why it\u0026rsquo;s called a book, how it came into being, and how its physical properties (such as cells and atoms) are combined. Here we focus on the resources of the object. Another example could be reflecting on the impermanence of the book - observing how it changes day by day, and recognizing that it ever truly is new. Here we focus on the reasons and logic of the object.\nHowever, in today\u0026rsquo;s time, most people who are interested in meditation are learning about concentration meditation. Typically, Westerners are very interested in concentration meditation, while there is a lack of interest in analyzing meditation. This may be because people who are struggling with depression or family problems or relationship issues often find temporary relief by focusing on one object for a time. So, they opt for concentration meditation.\n","permalink":"https://sangha.gssh.site/posts/meditation-experience-concentration-analyzing/","summary":"Today, I will outline the times of day when I engage in meditation.

Over the years, I have read numerous scriptures during my study times. However, these readings were not always based on personal preference but rather for exam purposes.\nDuring my free time, reading a book is quite rare in my life. However, a few years ago, I came across a book by our Guru, His Holiness the Dalai Lama. The title of the book was \u0026ldquo;My Land and My People.\u0026rdquo; This book has been an incredible and fascinating addition to my life. It recounts the story of when the Tibetans sought refuge in India and how His Holiness managed to stay in India for a long time.\nWhen His Holiness and the Tibetans arrived in India, they didn\u0026rsquo;t know mcuh about the conditions and climate of India. So they faced numerous challenges due to language and environmental differences. Many Tibetans lost their lives due to hot weather and unfamiliar food.\nIn this book \u0026ldquo;My Land and My People\u0026rdquo;, His Holliness writes about how he planned for their settlement in India. He established schools, monasteries, and hospitals, paving the way for future generations to receive an education. Today, we can look back on his vision and see its incredible impact on Tibetan life. With the implementation of his plans, most Tibetans have become educated.\nNot only that, many Tibetan lamas and Geshes have contributed significantly to Western and Indian society through education and psychology.

I focused on love and compassion, and recited some mantras of deities.\nAfter completing those tasks, I had breakfast with my disciple and shared some thoughts with each other. My disciple then went to his room to memorise the debating class scripture.

We do not need to think about families, occupations, or similar concerns. Our lifestyle is simple and free from many general problems. This is the life of a monk. However, before entering monk life, one must sacrifice various things, which many people are unaware of. They merely see monk life as happy and say \u0026ldquo;blah blah blah\u0026rdquo; behind them.

After a month, I was informed that I had passed the exam. Then I prepared for the biggest exam in my life.
