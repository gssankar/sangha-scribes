      <description>My monastery&amp;rsquo;s name is Sera Mey Monastery, located in southern India. Southern India is home to many monasteries; most of the larger ones are situated here. When His Holiness the Dalai Lama requested a state minister to allocate land for Tibetan refugees, the Karnataka Chief Minister kindly offered the land to His Holiness for this purpose. As a result, many monasteries and Tibetan colonies were established in southern India. However, we were only granted forestland, not pre-cleared land suitable for building houses or farming.</description>
