      <description>Today, I am going to describe my daily meals in the monastery. In our monastery and school, the meals are served by the monastery. I think this is similar to all monasteries and schools at any place. Typically, we have three meals a day in our monastery. We have a friendly kitchen for all monks. From there, they serve three meals to each monk every day. So, the schedule of the meal in a day is: morning bell ring at 7 am, afternoon at 11:30 am, and evening at 5 pm.</description>
