      <description>I have met many teachers in my life so far. From my school days, I started following their advice. In my school, I met various teachers through different subjects. But not all teachers are similar characters and have a different style of teaching. Some teachers teach very carefully, while others teach openly. Still, some teachers give many advices during teaching time, and some don&amp;rsquo;t. This is different from the styles of teachers and their mindsets.</description>
