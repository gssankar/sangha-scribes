      <description>My Monastery name is Sera Mey Monastic University, located in Karnataka state, South India. I joined Sera Mey Monastery in 1992. From 1992 to 2022, I dedicated all my time to studying various subjects and topics. When I first joined the monastery, I attended the school for studying modern knowledge education, including English, Mathematics, science, and Tibetan language. I studied these subjects for seven years.
At that time, my life was very interesting and happy.</description>
